## About me
I'm a software engineering student based in Hungary who takes great interest in programming and software design. 
I believe in free, open-source, fast and efficient software. In my opinion, most apps are bloated these days, so I want to become an engineer who can offset this trend. That said, not all my projects are "fully optimised". I'm still on the path of learning!

I mainly use C++ for my projects, although I learn Java and Haskell - amongst many other languages - at university as well.

<sup><sup>I use Arch btw.</sup></sup>
